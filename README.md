# Purpose of this project

This JavaScript library allows a developer to implement the Knora API without knowing technical details about it.
We published this library as `@knora/api` on NPM for easy integration into JavaScript projects.

# Changelog

TBD.

# Getting started

## Requirements

This library has been written to be used in any JavaScript project.
It may be integrated with any JavaScript framework/library of your choice, such as Angular, React, Vue.js, and more.

We recommend to install this library through NPM. This will make sure that all dependencies are installed.
At the moment, this library depends on `rxjs` and `json2typescript`.

In order to be able to integrate this library, you should have a basic understanding of `Observable`.
All HTTP requests to Salsah are done by using observables through the rxjs library.

## Installation

Run `npm install @knora/api --save` in the root directory of your project.

## Starting example

Below you may find a minimal example in TypeScript for the process of the user login.

If your IDE does not automatically help you with imports, these are the necessary files for the basic example:

```
import { KnoraApiConfig, KnoraApiConnection } from "@knora/api";
import { ApiResponseData } from "@knora/api/src/models/api-response-data";
import { ApiResponseError } from "@knora/api/src/models/api-response-error";
import { LoginResponse } from "@knora/api/src/models/v2/login-response";
```

Now, we will set up an instance of the class `KnoraApiConnection`. 
This instance can be your gateway to all API requests.
In most use cases, you will want to store this instance globally within your JavaScript application. 

```
// Set up a KnoraApiConnection instance. 
// We suggest to do this at your app entrypoint and store the instance globally.

const config: KnoraApiConfig = new KnoraApiConfig("https", "knora.org");
const knoraApiConnection: KnoraApiConnection = new KnoraApiConnection(config);
```

As soon as the basic configuration is done, you will be able to use the pre-defined methods provided by the KnoraApiConnection instance.
For example, you can login a user with a password as follows:

```
// Login the user to Knora.
// The method subscribe() is provided with two anonymous functions: 
// The first is launched in case of success, the second in case of failure.

knoraApiConnection.v2.auth.login("user", "password").subscribe(
    (response: ApiResponseData<LoginResponse>) => {
        console.log("Login successful!");
    },
    (response: ApiResponseError) => {
        console.error("Login failed!");
    }
);
```

Our library makes sure that session data (token) is stored within the KnoraApiConnection instance.
Any subsequent call after a successful login will be performed using the session.

> Remark: All API calls follow the same pattern. 
You will always need to subscribe to a method that returns an observable and then provide (up to) two anonymous functions.
The signature of the success function is always `ApiResponseData<TheData> => void`, the signature of the error function is always `ApiResponseError => void`.

# Scripts for testing and deployment

This package provides the following short-hand scripts:

1. `npm run test`: Runs the project's tests defined in `./karma.conf.js`. The coverage data is saved into the `./coverage/` folder.
2. `npm run build`: Builds the whole project without testing and puts the files into the `./build/` folder.
3. `npm run yalc-publish`: Executes 2 and publishes the package to the yalc app store.
4. `npm run npm-pack`: Executes 1, 2 and packs the `./build/` folder into an NPM tgz package. The package is moved into a `./dist/` folder.
5. `npm run npm-publish`: Executes 4 and publishes the package to the NPM store.

> Note: You need to install `yalc` globally by `npm install yalc -g` to use script number 3. In order to publish a package to NPM, you need to be logged in to NPM and you have to update the version in the `package.json`.
