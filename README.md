## Purpose of this project

This TypeScript library allows a developer to connect to the Knora API without knowing technical details about it.
We published this library as `@dasch-swiss/dsp-js` on NPM for easy integration into TypeScript/JavaScript projects.
The library is developed in TypeScript and declaration files are part of the package to allow for integration with other TypeScript projects.

## Changelog

See file `CHANGLELOG.md`.

## Getting started

### Requirements

This library has been written to be used in any TypeScript/JavaScript project.
It may be integrated with any JavaScript framework/library of your choice, such as Angular, React, Vue.js, and more.

We recommend to install this library through NPM. This will make sure that all dependencies are installed.
At the moment, this library depends on `rxjs`, `json2typescript`, and `jsonld`.

In order to be able to integrate this library, you should have a basic understanding of an `Observable`.
All HTTP requests to Knora are performed using an `Observable` through the RxJS library.

### Installation

Run `npm install @dasch-swiss/dsp-js --save` in the root directory of your project.
Make sure to install the lib's peer dependencies, see below.

### Dependencies and Peer Dependencies

This library depends on `RxJS`, `jsonld`, and `json2typescript`. `jsonld` and `json2typescript` are only used internally and listed as dependencies.

`RxJS` is listed as a peer dependency and **not** installed with `npm install`.
It can be installed with `npm run peer-deps` when you are working on this project.
`RxJS`'s `Observable` is used in this library's public API
and has to be compatible with whatever version of `RxJS` is used in the productive environment, e.g. an Angular application.
This library works with `RxJS`'s major version defined in `package.json` . See `rxjs.md` for details.

### Starting example

Below you may find a minimal example in TypeScript for the process of the user login.

If your IDE does not automatically help you with imports, these are the necessary files for the basic example:

```typescript
import { KnoraApiConfig, KnoraApiConnection, ApiResponseData, ApiResponseError, LoginResponse } from "@dasch-swiss/dsp-js";
```

Now, we will set up an instance of the class `KnoraApiConnection`.
This instance can be your gateway to all API requests.
In most use cases, you will want to store this instance globally within your JavaScript application.

```typescript
// Set up a KnoraApiConnection instance.
// We suggest to do this at your app entrypoint and store the instance globally.

const config: KnoraApiConfig = new KnoraApiConfig("https", "knora.org");
const knoraApiConnection: KnoraApiConnection = new KnoraApiConnection(config);
```

As soon as the basic configuration is done, you will be able to use the pre-defined methods provided by the KnoraApiConnection instance.
For example, you can login a user with a password as follows:

```typescript
// Login the user to Knora.
// The method subscribe() is provided with two anonymous functions:
// The first is launched in case of success, the second in case of failure.

knoraApiConnection.v2.auth.login("user", "password").subscribe(
    (response: ApiResponseData<LoginResponse>) => {
        console.log("Login successful!");
    },
    (response: ApiResponseError) => {
        console.error("Login failed!");
    }
);
```

Our library makes sure that session data (token) is stored within the KnoraApiConnection instance.
Any subsequent call after a successful login will be performed using the session.

### Test environment for Angular

`./test-framework` provides a ready-to-use test environment for Angular developers. See `./test-framework/README.md` for further instructions.

## Scripts for testing and deployment

This package provides the following short-hand scripts:

1. `npm run peer-deps`: Installs the project's peer dependencies. Peer dependencies are not installed with `npm install`, but have to be met before building or running the tests.
2. `npm run test`: Runs the project's tests defined in `./karma.conf.js`. The coverage data is saved into the `./coverage/` folder.
3. `npm run build`: Builds the whole project without testing and puts the files into the `./build/` folder.
4. `npm run yalc-publish`: Executes 2 and publishes the package to the yalc app store.
5. `npm run npm-pack`: Executes 1, 2 and packs the `./build/` folder into an NPM tgz package. The package is moved into a `./dist/` folder.
6. `npm run npm-publish`: Executes 4 and publishes the package to the NPM store (runs in dry-run mode).

> Note: You need to install [`yalc`](<https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc>) globally by `npm install yalc -g` to use script number 4.

For further development with Knora, the following scripts can be used:

1. `npm run integrate-admin-test-data <path-to-generated-client-code>`: integrates generated test data for the Knora Admin API,
see <https://docs.knora.org> -> Internals -> Development -> Generating Client Test Data.
2. `npm run integrate-v2-test-data <path-to-generated-client-code>`: integrates JSON-LD test data for Knora API v2,
see <https://docs.knora.org> -> Internals -> Development -> Generating Client Test Data.
The test data files have to be added to `scripts/v2-test-data-config.json`: `source` refers to their location in the Knora test data directory structure,
`destination` refers to their location in this repo. The test data files are copied when running the script.
3. `npm run expand-jsonld-test-data`: creates versions with expanded prefixes for Knora API v2 JSON-LD test data.
4. `npm run prepare-dev-publication`: prepares a dev version of the library for publication.
The dev versions contains mocks that produce tests data without a connection to Knora.
The mocks are configured in `scripts/mock-exports.json`.
If you need a local version of this lib that contains the mocks, do the following:
   - `npm run prepare-dev-publication` to prepare a dev version.
   - `npm run yalc-publish` to publish a local build containing the mocks.
5. `npm run webdriver-update` (from directory `test-framework`): updates Chrome webdriver for e2e tests   
   
## Change Supported Version of DSP-API

DSP-JS is compatible with a specified release of DSP-API. 
To update the target release of DSP-API, the following steps have to be carried out:
1. Delete local test data with `make delete-test-data`
2. Generate test data using the target DSP-API release, 
   see <https://docs.knora.org> -> Internals -> Development -> Generating Client Test Data.
3. Unpack generated test data and integrate it using the npm scripts 
    1. `npm run integrate-admin-test-data`
    2. `npm run integrate-v2-test-data`
    3. `npm run expand-jsonld-test-data`.
4. Run the unit tests with `npm test` from the project root.
5. Check for differences in the generated test data with respect to the previous release of DSP-API.
   If there are changes in the test data that have **no breaking effect**, integrate them (add them to the git repo).
   Otherwise, DSP-JS has to be adapted to comply with the later version of DSP-JS. Also see section "Integration of Generated Test Data".
6. Run the e2e tests against the target release of DSP-API:
   - prepare the local publication of the library using `npm run prepare-dev-publication`
   - build the library and publish it locally with `npm run yalc-publish`
   - change to directory `test-framework`
   - add the locally build library using `npm run yalc-add` and run `npm install`
   - run `npm run webdriver-update` and then `npm run e22`
7. Update DSP-API version in `Makefile`, e.g., change `--branch v13.0.0-rc.16` to `--branch v13.0.0-rc.17`.
8. See if the tests pass on GitHub CI   

## Integration of Generated Test Data

By default, all generated test data for THE admin API is integrated with the script `npm run integrate-admin-test-data`.

Test data for v2 has to be added to `scripts/v2-test-data-config.json` to be used in the unit tests.
All files that are contained in `scripts/v2-test-data-config.json` will be copied this library's tests data when running `npm run integrate-v2-test-data`.

Example:
```json
{
  "generated-test-data": [
    {
      "source": "/v2/ontologies/all-ontology-metadata-response.json",
      "destination": "./test/data/api/v2/ontologies/all-ontology-metadata-response.json"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The example shown above will copy the file `/v2/ontologies/all-ontology-metadata-response.json`
from the generated test data to the specified destination in this library's test data folder.
In the unit tests, this file can then be used to mock request and response data.

When adding a new method to a v2 endpoint, only add the test data needed to test this method to facilitate the review process.
**Do not add v2 test data that is not used in the unit tests.**

After integrating v2 test data, run `npm run expand-jsonld-test-data`.

## Publish a new version to NPM

Before publishing:

- Update README and CHANGELOG if necessary and commit the changes (currently, the CHANGELOG has to be updated manually)

- Be sure that the dependency to DSP-API is set to the correct version:
  - Update DSP-API version in `Makefile` (see section above)

A new version will be published with each Github release as it's part of Github actions' workflow. To make a new release, go to <https://github.com/dasch-swiss/dsp-js-lib/releases> and update the draft called "Next release" by changing:

- the tag version and the release title (same name) with the version number, e.g. `v3.0.0` or `v3.0.0-rc.0`
- If this is a pre-release, check the box "This is a pre-release"

New package will be available on <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dasch-swiss/dsp-js>.

At the moment (2020-06) all releases contain mocked data.
